<h1 id="draft-types">Draft Types</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>A <em>Draft Type</em> determines the order in which participants pick items from the <em>item pool</em> as a draft progresses.  Most draft types can be set up as either live drafts or automatic drafts.<br>
Divvy  supports several <em>Draft Types</em>, including; <em>”Round Robin”</em>, <em>”Snake"</em> and <em>“Single Round”</em> draft types among others.</p>
<p>Some of the factors to consider when choosing a draft type are; the number of  items to be divvyed up, how many participants there are and whether items will be split (roughly) evenly or if participants will intentionally be getting different numbers of items.</p>
<h2 id="round-based-drafts">Round Based Drafts</h2>
<p>In <em>Round Based</em> drafts the participants take turns picking items from the <em>item pool</em>, with each participant getting one pick per <em>round</em>. Rounds continue until all items in the <em>item pool</em> have been awarded.  The initial pick order for the first round is decided in advance and input by the <em>Draft Manager</em> when setting up the <em>draft</em>.</p>
<p>In summary -</p>
<ul>
<li>Participants take turns picking items</li>
<li>Each participant gets one pick per round</li>
<li>The initial order of picks for the first round is set in advance</li>
<li>Rounds continue until all items have been awarded</li>
</ul>
<p>The difference between the various <em>round-based</em> draft types is in how the picks after the first round progress.</p>
<h3 id="round-robin">Round Robin</h3>
<p>For most people, <em>Round Robin</em> drafts are a very familiar way to divvy things up.  As with all round-based drafts, the initial pick order is set in advance. Furthermore, in a <em>Round Robin</em> draft <strong>all</strong> subsequent rounds repeat the same pick order as the first round. Rounds simply continue <strong>in the same pick order</strong> until all items in the pool have been awarded.<br>
If the number of items in the <em>item pool</em> does not divide evenly among the participants then some participants will get one more pick (and therefore one more item) than others.</p>

<li>Some participants may get more picks/items (if number of items is not divisible by number of participants)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="snake-draft">Snake Draft</h3>
<p>Like <em>Round Robin</em>, a <em>Snake</em> draft provides each participant with a single pick in each round and then rounds continue until all items have been awarded.<br>
The difference is in the way subsequent rounds progress after the first round. In a <strong><em>Snake</em> draft</strong> the order of picks reverses each round. This means that, with four participants, and a first round pick order of; <strong>[<em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>D</em>]</strong>, the second round would use a pick order <strong>[<em>D</em>,<em>C</em>,<em>B</em>,<em>A</em>]</strong>. Note that this means that participant <em><strong>D</strong></em>  will make picks #4 and #5. Still, at the end of two rounds each participant will have made two picks.  The third round pick order then returns to the one used in the first round (<strong>[<em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>D</em>]</strong>) and it continues to reverse order each round until all items have been awarded.</p>

<p>This type of draft is considered slightly more fair when  used when a large number (hundreds to thousands) be used</p>

<h2 id="single-round-drafts">Single Round Drafts</h2>
<p>In a <em>Single Round Draft</em> the pick order does <strong>not</strong> occur in repeating groups of all participants, That is, there are no rounds. Rather, the pick order is defined in advance and the sequence of picks may allow some players multiple picks before another player makes their first  pick.  This type of draft is useful when the items to be divvied will be decided unequally.often appears to be rand</p>
