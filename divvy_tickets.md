# Divvy - Season Tickets Edition
Divvy is a convenient, efficient and fun way to divide sets of any type of items among a group of people.  
One very common use for Divvy is by  groups of sports fans who want to split the cost of season tickets and need to find a way to fairly devide the games at the start of a new season.   With _Divvy_ it's easy for the group to set up a private draft where each member can prioritize the games and players take turns picking from the games remaining. The process can even be fully automated so that the priorities of each participant completely drive the draft process.
